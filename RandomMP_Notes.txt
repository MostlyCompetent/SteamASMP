For now, I'm keeping "Exclude editor content when cooking" unticked since it only take up like 2mb and we're not trying to make this for mobile or something.

This happens when I have three clients running while starting the main menu

There's a total of 9 PlayerStates once each client logs in, one for each player, and an instance exists for each client

There's a total of 5 PlayerControllers. One exists for each player on the host computer, and on local computers, one exists for the client and one for the host.

Total of 3 GameStates, but it looks like they're the same GameState, but existing locally
	Yes, GameState is replicated across all clients, so it's a good place to store info all clients need (like 
	creatures left in wave, time left in match, tacos remaining in bathtub, etc.)

I believe the PlayerController is always created on the server first, then on the client.

This isn't multiplayer related, but I wanted to note it somewhere: in the engine content of a packaged game, there is a file called DefaultBloomKernel.uexp that's like 32mb. This is used for FFT bloom, which (I believe) is only used for convolution bloom, which we don't really use in games since it's too expensive, so it can probably go. I'm not sure if ticking "exclude editor content when cooking" makes that go away when you pack the game.
Just checked, it does not. So, if we're not using convolution bloom, we should be able to blacklist this file, which is described briefly here -> https://forums.unrealengine.com/development-discussion/android-development/118929-defaultbloomkernel-uexp-what-is-it-and-is-there-any-way-to-reduce-its-size
